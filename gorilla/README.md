# gorilla/mux implementation

Implemented `gorilla/mux` package to route articles with category and id. With `gorilla/handlers` it can implement
logging and works as a middleware, the output can be store to `Stdout`. This is really useful for web servers like Nginx
or Apache. Last but not least is implement other feature of `gorilla/mux` package such as strict slash.
